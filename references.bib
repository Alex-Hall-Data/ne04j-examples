abstract="The CAP theorem and the PACELC model have described the existence of direct trade-offs between consistency and availability as well as consistency and latency in distributed systems. Cloud storage services and NoSQL systems, both optimized for the web with high availability and low latency requirements, hence, typically opt to relax consistency guarantees. In particular, these systems usually offer eventual consistency which guarantees that all replicas will, in the absence of failures and further updates, eventually converge towards a consistent state where all replicas are identical. This, obviously, is a very imprecise description of actual guarantees.",
